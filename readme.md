This is repository to save experimental code and assignments for EVA course. This course is about Vision focused Machine Learning applications using Pytorch backend.

The code is structured with Week wise progress names w1, w2 etc.

**w1** - Basic questions on what are channels and kernels, from CNN perspective


**w2** - An implementation of DNN using `Convolution` and `MaxPooling` layers 

**w3** - An implementation of DNN with backpropagation with **Pytorch** basics
