MNIST Pytorch CNN Classification
#####

This folder consists of Google Colab / Jupyter notebooks, which build a CNN network to classify images in `MNIST <http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/>`_ Dataset



Each notebook (S1,..,S4) shows gradual progress in improving the model on aspects like:

- Model Size
- Training / test accuracy
- Training time, etc.


Please refer to the **Summary** cell at the end of each notebook to check the target and results in the respective experiments.

We were able to achieve an accuracy of 99.4% using the models here.
